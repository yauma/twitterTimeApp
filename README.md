# twitterTimeApp

TwitterTimeApp is a single screen displaying a tweet whose message contains the exact time (hour / minutes) when the app is launched.
For example if it's 10:13 in the morning, the app will show a tweet of someone mentioning that time, for example "I​t​'s 10:13 and I just woke up. Today is the big day"​.​

TwitterTimeApp is an original idea from Kerad Games http://www.keradgames.com

PD:
If you want to use Twitter Time App in your TimeZone, you have to change the constant MY_TIMEZONE = "America/Montevideo" in MainActivityFragment, for your local time zone.
